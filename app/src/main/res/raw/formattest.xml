            <page_text>\tThis is a test paragraph here. There are a lot of words and sentences that go together in some fashion to form a test of text content and formatting in the app. This is how a story would begin but this is not a story and therefore not of any consequence. Once again, this is just a test of formatting.\n\tEvery paragraph should be indented and begin on a new line. I also want to test the scrollability of the app so the longer these paragraphs are the better it will be for the application. The words go on and on and on and on.\n\tHere is some text from that other app. You're travelling to a distance city (that you’ve never been to before) to find work. As you get close to the city, you hear what sounds like a small fight a little off the path. You venture closer to see what is happening. Three guards are trying to trap one man. The man looks to be a weary traveller like yourself, wearing cheap leather clothes, and also like yourself, has a descent sword.\n\tThis is a test paragraph here.

                <button_text>This is the second test button and its purpose is to take you to page three. It also has a lot more text than the other buttons. These things should be short and to the point but some writers like to go on and on.</button_text>
