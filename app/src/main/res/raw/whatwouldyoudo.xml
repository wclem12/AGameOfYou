As you get close to the city, you hear what sounds like a small fight a little off the path. You venture closer to see what is happening. Three guards are trying to trap one man. The man looks to be a weary traveller like yourself, wearing cheap leather clothes, and also like yourself, has a descent sword.\n\nWhat do you do?</page_text>
